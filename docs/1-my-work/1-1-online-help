# Designing online help for a new global platform

## The problem
- An educational publisher was launching a new platform to a worldwide audience of teachers, learners, and educational administrators. Analytics and customer feedback from  previous platforms showed that without online support content users and the business would experience increased costs and a loss in perceived value.

## The gaol
For the support area to be a success: 
- the content had to support the most common and most important user tasks
- the language had to be simple enough for non-native English speakers to understand
- the organization of the content had to match the mental models of different user groups
 
## My role
- I worked with the Product Owner, UX Designers, Marketing, and Customer Support teams to define, design, test, and deliver an online support area.

## My process
- After discussing user stories with the Product Owner, I would create draft content in Confluence for stakeholders to review which I then presented to the development team during their sprint planning meetings.

## How did you drive the team or project forward?

### Reducing time to market
To allow the development team to focus on higher value features and increase the speed new content could be published, I created a business case for a separate Content Management System. I worked with internal technology partners to explore, prototype and ultimately agree a suitable solution that the project would go on to adopt.

### Supporting content translation into 20 languages
A need was identified for the content to be translated so I worked with translators,  and teams in local markets to deliver the content in approximately 20 languages. To reduce the time to delivery, I created a process to automate the formatting of translated content. 

### Improving the content collaboration process
The development team had initially been creating support articles from Word documents but had found this process to be problematic and wasteful for them.  As they were already working in Jira and Confluence, I created a space there for support content which made collaboration easier and more productive.

## Your outcomes
- I delivered batches of support articles in time to support new platform releases to the satisfaction of the Product Owner and a wide group of stakeholders.
- All articles met our tests for simple English and house style, and were written to an agreed template.
- Processes for monitoring Google Analytics of the pages and carrying out user testing were agreed to ensure continuous improvement.

### What I learned
So much! This project was an excellent - and fast - introduction to UX and Content Design in an Agile delivery environment. 

**Technical skills:**  card sorting, tree testing, readability, information architecture, and how to use Jira and Confluence.

**Team skills:**  how a large and diverse team works on a complex project, and how to navigate project and technical restraints creatively.
