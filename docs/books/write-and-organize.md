# Write and organize for deeper learning 
By Patti Shank (PhD)

## Learnability
How easy it is to learn something.

## Memory
Memory can be thought of in 2 states: working memory and long-term memory.

### Working memory
Working memory receives sensory information from the outside world. It can only store a limited amount of information for a limited amount of time. Once in the working memory, new information is checked with long-term memory.

### Long-term memory.
Long-term memory provides context for new information in working memory. If long-term memory contains information that's relevant to the new information (prior knowledge), this information can be used to provide context for the new information. 

## Prior knowledge
Knowledge stored in long-term memory about a topic or task.

## Mental effort  (Cognitive load)
The amount new information working memory is having to process to complete a task.

## Deep learning
Deep learning occurs when someone makes relationships within new information or with new information and existing information.

## Metacognition
- **Self-awareness**: knowledge of what helps you to learn effectively
- **Strategies**: knowledge of strategies that can be used to embed learning such as re-writing new information in your own words, asking questions to clarify concept, comparing your answers/understanding with someone else's.
- **Task**: what people already know or can find out about what's needed to complete the task successfully.
