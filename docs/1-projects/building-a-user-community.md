## The problem
- Whilst working remotely, the organization moved its workforce to Microsoft 365, introducing them to new applications and new ways of working. 
- Although the organization subscribed to a paid-for library of skills videos to help with knowledge gaps, users found this catalogue to be too large, and the videos too long to engage with. 
- As a result, people experienced frustration and resorted to workarounds rather than best-practices. 
- This resulted in inconsistent and incomplete adoption of the new services, and a large number of questions in a variety of internal forums.

## The goal
- To create a community space where we could deliver key messages in eas

## My role
- Working from an idea of sharing a 'tip of the week' video, I contacted colleagues in technology and communications to agree topics for the videos and a process for promoting them. 
- We agreed that I would produce each video and share it on the internal social network. 
- I would also write the promotional copy for both the company newsletter which would link readers to it.

## My process
- After researching each topic, I drafted a plan for the video content and then recorded and edited it in Camtasia. 
- The editing process focussed on keeping the videos short and the content clear in order to give users an experience of quick success. 
- Words and captions were avoided as much as possible as the videos would be going to an international audience, some of whom were not native English speakers. 
- Light-hearted backing music was added to balance the technical topics to make them as enjoyable as possible for a general audience.  
- Similarly, the social media posts were written in chatty but simple English to be as accessible and appealing as possible.

## The outcomes
- Over the course of several months, engagement with the videos grew from single figures to over 200 people watching.
- During meetings or in hallway conversations, colleagues began telling me how useful they found the videos, commenting on the suitability of their length and level. 
- The videos created a library where users could catch-up on any they missed, re-watch or re-share with their teams.
- Questions in internal forums also went down.

## What I learned
- Video planning, recording, and editing
- Writing for social media and newsletters
- Increased understanding of Communications and Enterprise Technology roles.
