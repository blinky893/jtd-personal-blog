## The problem
- An educational publisher was launching a new platform to a worldwide audience of teachers, learners, and educational administrators. 
- Analytics and customer feedback from  previous platforms showed that, without online support, users and the business would experience increased costs and a loss in perceived value.

## My role
- I worked with the Product Owner, UX Designers, Marketing, and Customer Support teams to define, design, test, and deliver an online support area.

## The goal
For the support area to be a success: 
- **the content** had to support the most common and most important user tasks
- **the language** had to be simple enough for non-native English speakers to understand
- **the organization** of the content had to match the mental models of different user groups

## My process
- I discussed and agreed user stories with the Product Owner.
- I moved the content development process from Word documents to the project's Confluence space to save developer time.
- The content I wrote in Confluence was sent to stakeholders for review.
- In sprint planning meetings, I presented the finished content to the development team for further discussion.
- A need was identified for the content to be translated so I worked with translators and teams in local markets to deliver the content in approximately 20 languages. 
- To reduce the time to delivery, I created a process to automate the formatting of translated content. 

## The outcomes
- Support content was delivered in time to support new platform releases 
- All articles met our standards for simple English and house style
- Processes for monitoring the effectiveness of the content were agreed  


## What I learned
This project gave me the opportunity to learn 
- how to design information architecture using card sorting and tree testing tools
- how to navigate project and technical restraints collaboratively and creatively
