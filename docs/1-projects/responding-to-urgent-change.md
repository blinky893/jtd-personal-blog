## The problem
- Two legacy platform needed to be relaunched urgently with updated support content. 
- It wasn't possible to make changes to the existing support pages for technical and business reasons, but we could redirect users to a new page.

## My role
- To identify possible no-cost solutions
- To develop a chosen solution
- To re-write and create new content

## The goal
- To deliver new and updated support content in time for the relaunch of each platform

## My process
- As the project had access to web-hosting space, developing an HTML-based site seemed the best and quickest no-cost solution
- I worked with an in-house UXUI designer, to create branded and responsive CSS and HTML templates for the new sites
- After consulting with Product Owners and Marketing teams, I re-wrote and adapted existing into the HTML templates
- I then prepared the finished sites for hosting, co-ordinating with the web-hosting team to get them tested and then published

## The outcomes
- Both sites were available in time for the relaunches 
- Both sites provided a significantly improved user experience
- Both sites could now be maintained more easily and make use of analytic tools

## What I learned
- Increased knowledge of HTML and CSS
- The value of being able to repurpose existing content
- The ability to find creative solutions to urgent problems
