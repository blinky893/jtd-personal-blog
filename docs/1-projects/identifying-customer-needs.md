## The problem
- The support area of a language-learning website relied heavily on text explanations written in English. 
- I surveyed sales consultants to verify if this was a problem for customers. 
- They confirmed that they often received requests for more visual explanations in the support content.

## My role
- Having identified and validated the problem, and after the Product Owner had agreed to my proposal, I produced and managed the delivery of a set of videos as part of a future release.

## The goal
- To improve customer satisfaction and reduce the number of contacts to sales consultants by adding explainer-videos to the most popular support pages.

## My process
- Using Google Analytics and conversations with the Product and Marketing teams, I determined which pages might offer the most value to users.
- I drafted voiceover scripts and collaborated with our audio team to have these professionally recorded.
- Using Camtasia, I then recorded and edited the videos to a consistent style, adding and editing the voiceover audio into them.
- The finished content was then handed over to a Marketing team, along with titles and description text that I'd written for each in simple English.
- Once the videos were live, I used the website's help authoring tool to embedded them in the correct pages for upload.
- I completed user acceptance testing and then tested them again when they went live on the Production servers.

## The outcomes
- The videos were very well received by sales consultants and the most popular received thousands of views and a good number of YouTube 'likes'.
- Analytics for the pages continued to be monitored for further improvements. 

## What I learned
- Validating an idea and collaborating with other teams to deliver it
- Editing skills and editing workflows 
- Drafting and editing audio for video
