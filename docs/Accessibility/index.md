# Why I care about accessibility


This is **Font Size 6** and **Font Weight 300**. It makes for a light and large introductory sentence beneath the H1.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 } 

The wrapper that creates this sub-heading style `{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }` goes at the end of the paragraph. On this page, I've it on a new line.

For this sentence, I've put it directly after the full stop to see if it makes a difference.{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }
