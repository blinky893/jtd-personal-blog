# What I wanted to learn
...and who I have to thank.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

As well as hosting my portfolio, I built this site as a way of learning some development skills including:

- how to use Git and Github
- how to write in Markdown
- how to host a static site on Github
- how to deploy a static site with Netlify
- and how to use VSCode to do a lot of the above

But I couldn't have learned any of these skills without the help of the developers who took the time to document their knowledge and share their skills. In particular, I'd like to thank the community behind the template for this site at [Just the docs](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/).
