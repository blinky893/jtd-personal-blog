Basic tips for writing useful documentation

## Summary
For a general audience, the tone and content of documentation should be simple, inclusive, and supportive.

## Make it simple

- Use short sentences
- Write in the present tense
- Explain words that are necessary but unfamiliar 
- Use concrete nouns and verbs, not metaphors or idioms 
- Ruthlessly remove words that are interesting but unnecessary

## Make it inclusive

- Use everyday words 
- Be device agnostic 
- Consider the age and accessibility needs of your audience
- Avoid cultural idioms and any language relating to gender, race, religion, or sexuality

## Make it supportive

- Focus on the reader’s objective
- Make it easy for the reader to scan your content
- Sound like a polite and knowledgeable human, not an impersonal system
