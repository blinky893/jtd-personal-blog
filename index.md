# Welcome

## Hello

Hello, my name's Chris and I design online documentation and deliver training. 

I want my work to help people **find information faster** and **learn skills more easily**. And maybe even enjoyably.

This site has [samples](/docs/1-work-samples/) of my work and you can also read my [tips for writing good documentation](/docs/2-writing-resources/).


## Acknowledgements

I built this site as a way of learning some development skills including:

- how to use Git and Github
- how to write in Markdown
- how to host a static site on Github
- how to deploy a static site with Netlify
- and how to use VSCode to do a lot of the above!

I'm grateful to all the developers who documented their knowledge and freely shared their skills. 

In particular, I'd like to thank the community of people behind the template for this site at [Just the docs](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/). 

If you'd like to build your own portfolio website for free, whilst learning some development skills, you can [read my story behind the site](/docs/3-about-this-site/).
