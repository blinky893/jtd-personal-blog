# About me

Hello, my name's Chris and I design online documentation and deliver training. 

I want my work to help people **find information faster** and **learn skills easily**. 

You can take a look at [samples](/docs/1-my-work/) of my work and read what I think makes for [good documentation](/docs/2-resources-i-use/index.md).


## Why I built this site

As well as hosting my portfolio, I built this site as a way of learning some development skills including:

- how to use Git and Github
- how to write in Markdown
- how to host a static site on Github
- how to deploy a static site with Netlify
- and how to use VSCode to do a lot of the above

But I couldn't have learned any of these skills without the help of the developers who took the time to document their knowledge and share their skills. In particular, I'd like to thank the community behind the template for this site at [Just the docs](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/). 

If you'd like to try building your own site like this one, you may enjoy reading [my story behind the site](/docs/3-about-this-site/).

## Contact me

Please feel free to contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thischriswood) or [Github](https://github.com/blinky893/) with any questions or feedback - I'd look forward to hearing from you.
