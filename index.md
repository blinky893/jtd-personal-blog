Welcome to Not Just The Docs!
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

This is my professional portfolio, personal knowledge base, and blog. Hopefully, it will give you a sense of who I am, what I'm interested in, and what I've learned.

I help people use things - usually software. I've done this with the title Technical Author, UX Writer, and Systems Trainer. The processes and products may differ a little between those roles but the objectives are mostly the same: to help people find what they need, understand what they find, and use that information to achieve their goals. (Credit to the [Center for plain  language](https://centerforplainlanguage.org/learning-training/five-steps-plain-language/) for that formulation.)
