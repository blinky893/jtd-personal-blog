I design documentation that helps people find information faster and learn skills more easily.

On this site, you can find:
- [projects I've worked on](/docs/1-projects/) 
- [samples of my content](docs/1-projects/samples-of-work.html) 
- [links to resources I use in my work](/docs/2-links/)

You can also find my [contact details](/docs/3-contact/).
