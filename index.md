## About me

Hi, my name's Chris and I design online documentation and deliver training. My aim is to help people **find information faster** and **learn skills more easily**.

This site has [samples](/docs/1-work-samples/) of my work and read my [tips for writing good documentation](/docs/2-writing-resources/).

## Contact me

Please feel free to contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thischriswood) or [Github](https://github.com/blinky893/).

## About this site

I built this site as a way of learning some development skills including:

- how to use Git and Github
- how to write in Markdown
- how to host a static site on Github
- how to deploy a static site with Netlify
- how to use VSCode to do a lot of the above!

I'm very grateful to the developers of the Jekyll template [Just the docs](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/) for it's template. 

If you'd like to build your own portfolio website for free, whilst learning some development skills, you can [read the story behind the site](/docs/3-about-this-site/)
