# Welcome

## Hello

Hello, my name's Chris and I design online documentation and deliver training. 

I want my work to help people **find information faster** and **learn skills easily** - and maybe enjoyably.

This site has [samples](/docs/1-work-samples/) of my work and you can also read my [tips for writing good documentation](/docs/2-writing-resources/).


## Why I built this site

I built this site as a way of learning some development skills including:

- how to use Git and Github
- how to write in Markdown
- how to host a static site on Github
- how to deploy a static site with Netlify
- and how to use VSCode to do a lot of the above

But I couldn't have done any of these things without the help of the developers who took the time to document their knowledge and share their skills - thank you. 

In particular, I'd like to thank the community behind the template for this site at [Just the docs](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/) for creating such a helpful template. 

If you'd like to try building your own site like this one, you may enjoy reading [my story behind the site](/docs/3-about-this-site/).

## Contact me

Please feel free to contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thischriswood) or [Github](https://github.com/blinky893/) with any questions or feedback - I'd look forward to hearing from you.
