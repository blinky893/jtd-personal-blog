# Hello, I'm Chris.

I design online documentation that helps people find information faster and learn skills more easily. 

On this site, you can:
- look at [samples of my work](/docs/1-my-work/) 
- see my [design tools](/docs/2-design-tools/)
- read [my areas of interest](/docs/3-areas-of-interest/)

### Contact me

I'd look forward to hearing from you on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thischriswood) or [Github](https://github.com/blinky893/).
