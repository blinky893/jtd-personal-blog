# About me

Hi, my name's Chris and I design online documentation and deliver training that helps people **find information faster** and **learn skills more easily**.

You're welcome to explore [samples](/docs/1-work-samples/) of my work and read my [tips for writing good documentation](/docs/2-writing-resources/).

## About this site

I built this site as a way of learning some development skills including:

- how to use Git and Github
- how to write in Markdown
- how to host a static site on Github
- how to deploy a static site with Netlify
- how to use VSCode as an IDE 

This site has been built using the Jekyll template [Just the docs](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/)
